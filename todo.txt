										deDupIdentical
												length of return ary
												number of exact duplicates
												bool- removed null record
										-autofillandcollapse
												number filled
												number collapsed
												remaining
										conflicts
												+(count) of records with unqfields
												count of how many unqKeys have conflicts (vv obj.keys.length vv)

												conflctsObj w unqField vals as top-keys
														an array of conflicted recrdobjs
																w the unqkey removed



// Notes on test csv
		All dups have one field removed except
				"Explorama Lodge, Amazon"

NOTES

		-Where to add entityType string? For some reason adding
				params to the execute api members function are erroring undefined
		-CONFLICT OBJ
				Including the null record in the duplicate count rather than as bool
						due to undefined also being a case for removal and
						for the sake of the count

		--auto fill is adding extra candidates somewhere. not really affecting anything
				because the few dups are removed.


				---Isolate null records before autofill
						count
			ConflictObj
				---display unqKeyField
						--rcrds w null key field (cnt) array of obj

			Find where org object is being manipulated and remove clone.

			find conflicts:
					processed {
							unqkeys []
					}

TODO
	Add placeholders by entity and column to the translation dictionary, so that placeholders can be converted to nulls regardless of format.
