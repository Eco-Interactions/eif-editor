Flesh out file set validation
	--are there 3 csv files exactly?
	--does each of the three have a name that maps to a distinct entity?
		"2 identified of 3 expected. Not able to find the file for (entity). Please
					use a file name with csv extension and (entity) in the file name. "
		--Went with invalid file name instead as it will catch this error without changing the code structure.

	possible errors with files themselves
		--is this file empty?			'the file (entity.csv) is empty'
		make sure there are at least as many headers as there are cols in dict
			--if some fields, but not all, tell them which ones are missing
				colCheckList = object.keys(hdrDict)- rmv as found
					--The following cols are missing ^.join n-missing of x-expected
		probs matching cols-
			--if a col in file is not in dict, leave related col data behind.
		probs matching any rows-
			--if (missing part of a row) stop and report row number (row x of the data in fileName didn't parse)

	--Just before giving tulen their copy--
		With fresh data, double check each row is the row it should be from the spreadsheets,
		delete those rows from csv files.
			they should then, with all validation errors deleted, load into grid.
				Check to make sure every row that is now in csv is also in the final grid.
