Notes:


Fixing Taxa Notes:
	Cheecking for null taxa used to happen where the names were concatonated together...
		now needs to happen where taxa recrds are built into objects
	check for same level, conflicting parents.

	add rcrdsWithConflicts to error checking, reporting, and all-errors set







---TODO---
Add error handling to webview

catch tags with single character??

Taxonym need a collection of namings




Taylor:
	leave targeturl set to false unless role beta or higher?
