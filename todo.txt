Taylor:
		#status-bar styles not being applied
		setStatus only sometime works and I have no idea why
				left logs in for clues.


Flesh out file set validation
	--are there 3 csv files exactly?
	--does each of the three have a name that maps to a distinct entity?
		"2 identified of 3 expected. Not able to find the file for (entity). Please
					use a file name with csv extension and (entity) in the file name. "
		--Went with invalid file name instead as it will catch this error without changing the code structure.

	possible errors with files themselves
		--is this file empty?			'the file (entity.csv) is empty'
		make sure there are at least as many headers as there are cols in dict
			--if some fields, but not all, tell them which ones are missing
				colCheckList = object.keys(hdrDict)- rmv as found
					--The following cols are missing ^.join n-missing of x-expected
		probs matching cols-
			--if a col in file is not in dict, leave related col data behind.
		probs matching any rows-
			--if (missing part of a row) stop and report row number (row x of the data in fileName didn't parse)


TODO:
	report missing taxon fails
	refactoring:
		val report
		taxon parsing
