Commemorative notes:
	/*
		  * New button on toolbar
		  * select folder
		  * find all csv files in folder, if more than three- fail validation and return (filter- isFile and .csv for collection)
		  * for each file, look for known entity file substr in filenames (interaction, citation, author)
		  * objectify each file and pass all into parse at once {entity: recrds}
		  * if validates successfully- flag and return results
		  * else return meaningful information about any issues in process
		  * add fullSet to dictionary
		  *
		  * Taxa
